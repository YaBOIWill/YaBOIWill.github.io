## Past Projects
These are some programming projects I have worked on for my Computer Science 230 class at UNCG. Programming Project 3 asked me to create objects such as Author and to write a create a Person super class derive sub classes from it. Programming Project 5 had me writing recursive programs to check if a given string is a palindrome, convert numbers to binary, and to return reverses of strings as well as positive integers.
